## APIs

### 1. What is Custom API, and how can I get access to Custom API? Are there any difference with Task API?

* [Task API](/platform/features/api/sql-api/datacloud-task-api): Asynchronous real-time requests with high data freshness (less concurrency scenarios).
* [Custom API](/platform/features/api/sql-api/datacloud-custom-api): High concurrency and low latency (with slightly reduced data freshness, at least 5 minutes).

Custom API is not available for all users. Please contact us for more information.
